# ScrollStepClass
A small script that adds css step classes depending on scroll value

## Usage

### In HTML

Add a css class defined in ScrollStepClass.js (scrollStepNodeClass variable, default 'ssn')
Define css class that should be added with each step with **data-ssn-class** attribute
Define amount of steps to be taken with **data-ssn-steps** attribute
Define step threshold with **data-ssn-threshold** attribute (measured in pixels)

### In CSS

Define step classes (by default the step class name is *data-ssn-class*-step-*step* for example: *scroll-action-step-1*)

## To do

1. The script is quite crude and I want to rebuild it & make it easier to configure soonâ„¢
2. Change the script so that the element starts being tracked when it enters the viewport, but is tracked even if it leaves it (the script looses track when user scrolls too fast)
3. Refactor
